Binary-ScreenSaver
==================

Yet another binary screensaver

All that is left is the screensaver part
which will be in c#

The website part is for fun, just like everything else.
Also the gh-pasges branch thing seems less simple, so all website files go with the ss files. :D

ToDo:
<ul>
<li>Make the website into a screensaver with c#</li>
</ul>
